# Developer-Profile-Generator
* For this assignment we are to create a pdf generator which would help in preparing reports in a quick way.

## Business Context

* When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

## Useability 
* multiple npms have to be installed, they are mentiones inside the package.json file.
* This will create both an html and a pdf file upon activating it.
* The program will ask two questions of the user, it will ask for their github name and for them to choose a color.
* Then it will get the info for the user and create the files using the color the user selected.

## Images
* This is how the program runs.
* Example of how to use it is under the images folder.
* Screenshots were used to show how it worked to create the html


## Work
* I still need to make the html convert into a pdf file.
